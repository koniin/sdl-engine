// Game Feel TODO:
/* ==========================

All gfx can be found in shooter_spritesheet.png
[X] Bullet gfx (big)
[X] Ship gfx
[X] Enemy gfx
[X] Muzzle flash (circular filled white first frame or something or display bullet as circle first frame)
[X] Bullet spread (accuracy)
[X] Hit animation (Blink)
[X] Enemy knockback (3 pixels per frame in the direction of the bullet, would be countered by movement in normal cases)
[X] Screen shake on fire weapon
[X] Screen shake on hit enemy
[X] player knockback on fire weapon (if player is too far back move to start pos for demo)
[X] Sleep on hit an enemy (20ms)
[X] BIG random explosion/s on kill (circle that flashes from black/grey to white to disappear for one update each)

Do movement and then:
[X] Area larger than the screen with camera
[X] Camera lerp - follow player
[X] Camera towards where player is aiming
[X] Camera kick - move camera back on firing (moves back to player automatically if following)

[ ] engine flame from ship(s) - or we do this with one sprite that changes shape 
    - steredenn uses fixed animation depending on speed
    - luftrausers uses fixed sprite that changes shape rapidly and only shows on forward movment

Particles
[ ] Follow bullet first few frames
[ ] Smoke or something when firing from ship
[ ] Particle spray on explosion?

[ ] check the clip from dropbox with the game maker thing and take notes

Then:
[ ] Player ship rotation animation (exists in sheet)
[ ] Sound - just test with a fire sound and hit sound
[ ] Animatons
[ ] More base in sound effects

* Leave something behind when something is killed
    - destroy hit enemy
    - respawn after some time at random pos on screen
    - debris at spawn site that doesn't move away - how it looks does not matter now

* Smoke on explosion - particles

When solid objects that are unbreakable:
* Impact effect (hit effect, like a little marker on the side we hit)

For GUNS
* Gun gfx
* Gun kick - make it smaller or something when firing
* Smoke on fire gun
[ ] Shells or something fly out on fire weapon (make it a "machine gun") - depends on bullets/gun

* BIG random explosions
